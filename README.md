# React Sudoku Game

A logic-based number placement sudoku game in React. The point of the game is to fill a 9x9 grid with numbers so that each column, row, and 3x3 subgrids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

This game can generates random sudoku boards based on three difficulties (easy, medium, and hard) in the player's browser, solve user entered Grids, and transform uploaded sudoku image into grid to be solved!

## App Launching:
Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/AssaadWansa/NavyBits-Internship-Challenge---Sudoku-Game-`

Once you have the repo files in a local directory, run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

### Run the program by using `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
